As for the heist we threw around so many ideas it was great to watch it all unfold. Sad no geomancy had to be used,actually, I honestly felt quite useless during that fight. Everyone contributed so much to the fight but I really didn't do much. Makes sense for my character to feel that way haha,nah, I was just trying to joke around with the climbing on the mast,aparently worked in my favor,although, while looking at the battle. I realized that my Armor of Shadows Eldricth Invocation which casts Mage Armor on myself is actually quite useless,I have 13 AC to start off with but Mage Armor is 13 + dex which was 0,so an action to do absolutely nothing,Gotcha.

If you have a nested loop, it's considered to be worst case O(n^2) because you have to loop for every loop so to speak,there's more special cases but those are the most common ones you'll see,The weekend before the 22nd or the weekend after?,sounds like Thanksgiving break for us students,no, great timing,more or less,but... ur my family ❤️,ur all my family ❤️,,actually, Hackerrank had a very good video that explains it, let me find it,[object Object],I knew specifically the Hackerrank one. this is the first time of me hearing about this,well, I suppose I didn't know because I watched the video on Hackerrank instead ^3^,complete true,same fam,Give me your hair >////<,Hey ❤️,I challenge you to a duel,send,Ohh.

I don't even know who I can even cosplay effectively,that's why I get enamored with people quickly if they play their personality with their sona,I care more about the sona than people :V,OwO,I'm ready,for your evolution,it's an evolution in my eyes if you make your character better than your previous one,If it's more like you, thus you can interface your personality more though your sona better, then it's an evolution,it's alright if you have no clue what the heck I'm talking about uwu,it doesn't go to waste actualy. watching the evolution of your character is pretty fun,you still HAVE your character,you know, I've come to really appreciate sharks,cause sharks are hot,but yeah,this is exactly the reason uwu,,that's verryyyy goooood,yooo, coooool,Otto-san~,yep,I like the name too,what con is that?,Meee,Made a chat for those going to momocon,[object Object],oh yes,Currently working for another hour. just still looking through this database to see if anything cool I can find about the data inside of it,in fact this morning I created a Python Script to connect to my database and to output to a text file the names of all tables that actually HAS data in them,excuse me,Python is the BEST language,that would be pretty neat. I learned what String.split() do and man, python is crazy awesome,It's really great language to learn! more than Java in my eyes at least,even though I know wayyyy more Java than python,I wouldn't say Java is great though, Java isn't really hard.,to be fair, all english speakers barely know english,that's why Japanese is so much better >w>,Madman,It would be badass,and REALLY FREAKING FAST too,since assembly translates directly into machine code without much effort,true vs True in Python: What the heck is true? ohhh, True! gotcha,literally learned that this morning,I'm running Arch Linux at work right now. I love the AUR package manager approach,where can I send you money to buy this,Enterprise Applications at my school,I've.. been doing quite random things as of now.,noice,I went to a Global Game Jam two years ago and made a game,I believe I still have the game on me. it's REALLY trash though,I'd love to make more games,buttt. I'd rather play them :>,looking for the video I uploaded to youtube to show it off lol,[object Object],now time to hide lol,I actually had two versions of the game, Alpha (the one I turned in) and Beta (the nearly unbeatable massive amounts of objects flying at you_,only one person has beat the beta,apparently the strat is to jump at the right time to get hit twice in the air to slip PAST the guy's hitbox,Actually. rather than syncing it starts up in a Linux Virtual Machine,no fickle syncing,I believe you are able to view without an account but chatting requires an account,Yes.

I neeed moreeee,I'm just kinda sitting waiting for the novels to come over so I can read them,I just want to be invested into the story and world and characters that explores philosophical themes,I dont think I'll ever stop talking about NieR,Nopeee. I need to take some pointers from you,This,Actually,Taste it,Hand Shakers is objectively bad,[object Object],Literally a show where I hated every single character that opened their mouth,My dad liked it,No amount of prayers can save him. For he has caught up with One Piece,,I do the same actually when femboys come up.

Golbez in psp dissidia was my shitt,Dam,Gotta come over and play it,I personally loved the Labyrith mode in Duodecim,I played so many hours into that game cause of that mode,I personally think those AMAs of peoples sonas are pretty silly thing to do. Simply because they are so stubborn and not get a little hand on it or you can do this by making them look more attractive.,Yeah. Attention seeking is really off-putting.,Notice me senpai,,You are important to me too~,My rabbit,My dad watched it all,Yes,And fairy tail,My dad watched it all cause he's some kind of anime monster. Also yeah he watches anime,More anime than I do actually,The only one who doesnt watch anime is my mom in my family,My dad has a huge collection of comic books,Marvel and DC,Probably more but ive only pulled out the top 100 of that collection,Oh. My dad isn't very political,But I assume mentioning you voted for Trump already loses you friends,He looks like me but older so take that with a grain of salt,Yes,Oh,Rip,Well. My widows peak makes my hairline not straight,Not that pronounced jfc,As the guy in the comment section said in Chinese. 可愛い~,No,I just said what he said in Japanese,But you already know that lol,Actually kinda functional? I mean it's harder than Japanese,I get dyslexia trying to look at Chinese,High level Japanese kinda looks like Chinese at a glance lol,Kanji retains it's meaning between the languages,Yeah only the phonetics behind them are different. 可愛 in chinese is ka ai while 可愛い in japanese is kawaii,...,At a glance it should be kaai in both languages if we follow the rules,This is just something I learned when I had a friend who was learning Chinese at the same pace I was learning Japanese,And make learner's of the language cry cause they don't follow the rules set down for them. Like English,South African and American?,Those are totally languages,We weren't about to get into Pawltics,I wanna hear Tensei call someone a wanker,Yeah. The hell is a muffin,Lolol,Who puts gravy on a sweet biscuit lol,Madmen,You know what. Why is that easy to imagine,They ARE?,Wat,,We are the weird ones,Educate us,The Mickey,Lol,eehh?,hmm,I barely understood most of it but that last part was hilarious,Ahhh. I seee now,is it updatedd yet,oh,I'm such trash to be this race in FFXIV uwu,It's definitely a fun one,A bit vulgar. Like even the original crazy frog didn't have a phallus like structure on his crotch ,[object Object],Your right!,,,Two stickers put together explains my feelings rn,Leave it to me,,that gif took me a while to make,I love you more,I was gonna get really happy to tell you. but then I honestly think this game is one of the worst ones in the franchise. The game is called Tales of Zestiria, if you heard anything about the Tales of series, it's an action RPG,without words, this is why I love tales of games, starting at this point,[object Object],*rage mode activates*,Tales of Zestiria story wise was just a bit of an unexplained clusterfuck. Sorey, is your insert basic main character, becomes a Shepard to defeat Hellions and to defeat the Lord of Calamity to bring about the age of prosperity again. towards the end, the game stopped losing cohesion for me and I just wasn't enjoying it anymore. Gameplay wise, I honestly loved a return to the Graces' forumla but I feel like somewhere they took a TERRIBLE direction. You can't customize your moveset anymore, basically you get a chain of moves you can weave in and out of instead of making your own combos... like.... an actually modern tales games for fucks sake. outside of the battle system... the progression system is FUCKING GOD DAMN AWFUL. The game's equipment system is based on Abilities and Slots, you'd have to fuse weapons and equipment together to get bonus effects and stacked effects. except here's the fucking issue. you can't choose which slot an ability goes on. so you'd have to fight enemies and find the right type of weapon. with the right amount of skills you want, in the exact SLOT that you want them to be in or else you'd fuck your entire build. Honestly, with so much grind that THAT bullshit incurs, you can't honestly expect players to like theory craft because getting equipment mid game is honestly stupid since it'll take you like ~100 hours to finish a build based on RNG... oh... did I mention you had to do this for the game's 5 OTHER PARTY MEMBERS AS WELL!?,and lastly but not least,the final boss is so bullshit,it's a fucking DPS check,honestly the worst fuckin mechanic to have coupled with that shitty ass progression system. you'd have to turn the game's difficulty down if you've not been grinding up equipment and stuff if you wanted to win the game. no skill. just dps check,*rage subsides* sorry for the rant,I'd say the game is a buy at $20-25 though. still fun to play,game didn't need to take this long,My life is a kusoge,Let that date be me,I'll be all like. I rather play Hunniepop,,Lol wording,頑張ります,lol,chaos is a skateboarding proo,i love u 4 everything,it's super cute~ ,[object Object], did it,me,I can pin it, it's also better than our current pin,,no @ everyone for it though,I might wanna do that at one point.,But I want kanji,But good it's there!,You use a lot of kanji I don't understand so I'd have to look it up anyway lol,I mean. Sometimes,Lol,Oh.,lolol,,I'd date Mara if he wasn't always such a dick,It's a European badger,Looks really good,If I didn't have bills right now,Hell. I'd bid $200,Yeah. It's close to the style that I wanted for my head,Yeah. I've no clue my head size,Although. I'll wait to get my head. I want it to be really really good and on my point,Willing to spend like 700-800 on it,The head of all heads,I want it to be freaking fantastic,Flawless in design,That's why I'd spend 200 on that one,Had I had the money I'd have bid 200. It's a really good head that's still a badger,I'll eventually get a really good accurate one,How about I do u? Ur cool enough for me to be you,Wow. I know the reading of the word but not the meaning,I n t e r e s t i n g,Ofc I was gonna look it up. Just found it interesting I was able to find the reading before the meaning,I knew 当 but 然 reminded me of 全然,So I deduced the reading,Lol,Exactly what I'm going for too,If you're gonna pay 1000 might as well go all the way,I'm actually triggered looking at this,Luwyn also got Daganronpa 2 from what I saw,Almost like,Media repost,I agree actually,like,right now?,at first I was like ehh pokemon go,but then I saw two player battles,👀,*cough cough*,wait, aren't switch games $50 MSRP tho,I mean would this spark Pokemon GO's popularity back?,I mean not to the grand scale of what It once was,I remember I had Windows Phone at the time, I would tag along with my friends to like a huge group to go pokemon hunting,pokemon what? I didn't hear anything about that game,looks like it doesn't exist,sorry bro,Oh christ,Lol,Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee,Revealed yesterday after rumors,>the game is just an over glorified Pokemon Go clone,Genwunners,God,To be fair gen 6 is trash,Yoooooo. That was fun thing to do,Wait. There are people who think this is a main series game?,Those poor souls,Didn't they already reboot Pokemon with ORAS?,Another one you think?,No. ORAS with Episode Delta,It was revealed that there was a world were mega evolutions didn't exist. And that they would connect to those world's using a omnipotent connection,Thus the latter games are entirely in a different universe Canon wise,Give me a second,I'll divine the future of Pokemon,In the future of Pokemon, I've learned that Lycanroc midnight form is trash,I wanna play mystery dungeon,I love mystery dungeon ok,,oof,finding games to play right now actually is painful,I installed For Honor,then uninstalled it,I don't have Danganronpa monery,or any money right now for that fact,noooo,nuuuu,well. I lost all of my dark souls 3 data,,SCREW DARK SOULS 1,*cough*,*twitches*,Gen V is actually my favorite too,Gen VI is trash tho,if you like Gen VI,then ur trash,I personally enjoyed N, I think he's a fantastic antagonist,The story was seemingly going to go in a great fashion but N's father decided to bring back the WORLD DOMINATION trope,and I ignored it,,I've not gone to the grocery store,does that mean being a furry weeb gamer makes me triple degenerate,except I'm speaking to furry weeb gamers,so we are all degenerate,Team Skull is honestly my favorite pokemon team antagonist,well. I don't know if Lusamine is kinda different in US/UM,I've not bothered to get past thee first trial,Gengar... was always that thicc right?,I'd give that Gengar a hug if it wasn't a ghost type,Lolol,Calling each other's platforms old then the new ones just bring out their SWITCH,なんだそれは,Wow,I'm amazed,No online play?,I mean. The game in this day and age probably needs to be a SAAS model,To deliver hours and hours of content to keep the game going longer,The novelty will run out pretty quick,But yeah. Super fun little couch co op game,Lol. That does make it better,There can only be one good God boy,Can't blame Suicune if we all remember their backstory,I want some fan art of u,It really is~,I think that's Flareon on the right but what's the other one,Ahh. I forgot Vulpix existed,There's 700 of these. I'm bound not to remember all of them,Regional variations was indeed pretty cool,Let me know of the biology of co"**rirus,Apple has been going Godfather on Telegram recently,I mean. I'm good for Telegram not taking any shit from Russia about not providing their Russian users private decryption keys,Yeah. Freaking Russia,Was telegram x pulled from iOS store,Comply with Russia?,Yellow?,Inb4 it actually happens,I can technically be a dog pokemon,I sense that this will be used on me quitee often,oh no,Vrooooooooooooooooom,Do I know that character?,I thought so,Looked so familiar,Love you~,You too senpai,,Full body hug,,[object Object], Go Nuts for Donuts tournament at Papa Johns,JASON,in my dms,I wanted to forget that exists,Persona 5 is great,been playing it all day,my brother's girlfriend let me borrow their PS4 for a month,so yeah I started this morning and haven't put it down,I can't see how people forget to eat, I've made myself a buffet in my room to eat while playing lol,only if u share your stash too,it's such an overbearing feeling, it's hard to ignore such a thing,I honestly don't understand how,Same,could have a third someday and call it a date with Nova,,I,I have no response other than holy freaking shit this sounds accurate,,Most of everything I say eventually has the end of me getting to usee this sticker,,this is definitely a nice answer at least ❤️,So. How do y'all wanna watch E3 this year?,Set up a ,[object Object], perhaps for some select conferences?,One problem is that they are all so spread out so it'll be kinda hard to set such a thing up,Mainly cause people are working too much to upkeep the room,Alright. We can probably work out a super team task force to schedule out our streams,I cannot unsee this now,Wait. Which games?,On the store?,I think Pokebank yeah,$5 a year,Really?,Holy fuc,I've never thought of that,The only shiny I actually saw in my games where when I was playing Emerald and ran into one before the game introduced Pokeballs,I'd rather not,Or,I'd have to finish UM,Shiji-san. Surely that isn't BIAS I hear?,Shiny hunting is really fustrating,I know it's easier with SOS chains,But s t I l l,Ehh?,Were you talking to me?,I didn't even know Shiny Charm was a thing,Yeah same.

Minigolf?,Cause that's what the fights really were,I'm so tiredddd,,Yeah. I'm sure work would let me sleep,(due to the nature of my job I probably could lay my head down and no one would bat an eye),Look.

He'll be restored into the same model,Not far enough in the game to know why I did it,20 mins till next e3,Sony,Lolol,ETERNAL MOOD,Admittedly I've not played Doom,Oh right!,It was using Vulkan technology,I wonder if more games are using the API,Lol this,The only support Linux has is it's users,TALES OF VESPERIA,H O l y m o l y,I finally get a chance to play the BEST tales of game in it's ultimate form,Repede is both a bad boy and good boy combined,I love how his artes are derivatives of actual artes but end in dog,Sonic Thrust => Sonic Dog,Gurenken => Gurenken,but japanese changes from 紅蓮剣 to紅蓮犬,from sword to dog,Eh,Hrl,Tired,I'll jon,oh, crap,i can't join ;/,well,I can,like just nnot come to work tomorrow,no one bats an eye,i woke up just in time for the next e3 rightt?,cause uhh.

2. shut down
3. use sticker,it's great,yes actually,I like... stopped watching and paying attention,and chatted on telegram,that was super hella scripted,but the engine looked nice,also,God of War,It felt like that when Elle was swinging the axe xd,,plot twist, this interview means that the conference is over,gg scripted scene of the last of us was the entire show,lolol,I didn't wanna watch the interview just to wait till more COD?,come on sonyyy,Microsft imo was the best as of now,MAPS?,THE HELL?,my streamer whose watching it asked "Should I just go back to playing Vesperia JP lol",wait. what?,the show didn't start yet?,I'd watch Ubisoft's Just Dance 2019 intro for the e3 compilation,it was L I T,in the trash,they do have to use the whole hour something for like no games,kek,gotta pad it somehow,woahhhh,it's gorgeous,PREBAKED SHADOWS,this game does look good,but Sekiro,SEKIRO,God of War became the new standard of gaming now,this is like Samurai Assassins Creed,I think it's kinda like TLOU where it's kinda scripted but then actual gameplay,w a t,I'm S H O O K,oh snap. they didn't do another intermission,same mannnn,I don't have thee job or time for these gamees smh,lets just move in together and both of our paychecks would suffice,Character Design is bland,I've... not played much Resident Evil,that looks really good,yeah 4 was the only one I played before my parents took it away from me,this is actually annoying me,priate ship gameplay in KH,Pirate games are aall thee rage kek,finallyyy,HIDEO KOJIMA,... crap. that was kinda hot,the invisible monster closing in on you slowly,huff,I'm super disappointed,here's a better trailer for you all,[object Object],lolol,yes,I'm hosting a ,[object Object], for the conference,I'm hosting a ,[object Object], for Nintendo E3: 
,[object Object],that's fine :>,,👀,but,Alm,whose Chrom?,,6 min,also, that video is 4 years old,so,will this draw the Melee players to come back to Smash 4 Ultimate,wolf is my spirit animal,but dedede is my god,cause it's over,Nintendo's Directs are usually an hour,Lol,Melee is a shit game anyway,Didja miss the Nintendo Direct,S a d,And Ridley,Man. I wish I could tell you EVERYTHING. But basically Smash Switch will have all characters from past smash games, plus inkling and Ridley.,Dragonball FighterZ switch,Fortnite Switch,It is BIG,It's killing Smash U,Also. Comes out December,Its basically Smash U but better,Plus inkling from Splatoon and Ridley from Metriod,Oh,No new news for Metroid Prime 4,,Can we switch it back?,No Solaire of Astoria Smash,Sorry game is 9/10,m e l e e,is trash,Smash 4 was better in every way ;3,love you too ,[object Object],uwu,I'm actually glad to see them adding some better mechanics to make it EVEN easier to play. like short hop attack by pressing up and attack at the same time,always had problems short hop attack,and Melee it's next to impossible to short hop,when I tapped. I did full,like,it hurt,wait, what,short jump was based on jump squat frames?,in melee?,wow,how to be trash,what I really meant was,timing was different,for everyone,and that's stupid ;w;,hot damn,that's clean,as f,oh you are right,oh I forgot about that,oof,I mean I'mma have to practice that alot,thatll be interesting,actually,maybe,in a future update,I also don't play smash,I love the animation heavy style they added to really strong moves,can't wait for Zelda's kick to send you right to hell,i'd let the new zelda kick me tbh,my orientation may vary,lol,Nintendo Treehouse is doing like a 2 hour thing,I'm not watching it but uhh,wait,Perfect Shield.... how will that work against Marth's Shieldbreaker?,wouldn't that make it more effective since you have to like get hit by it I think,Melee killer,bois,Shadow will probably be an echo character of Sonic,And what? Have smash become an actual fighting game?,It's just the melee hell that's a echo chamber of melee fanatics that wants Smash Ultimate to die,Which is hilarious content actually,Well. Its obviously a satire Facebook page lol. But the whole thing is that melee is the best smash game,Nintendo already has the melee market playing melee,Sounds about right lol,I actually have no opinion of woof. Looks pretty cool but I've never played him,Can you actually be any more wrong? I mean we know brawl is better than melee,Man. Being able to suck up gordo with Dedede is gonna be fun,Can't wait to actually lab around with more dedede,Love my bird king :>,,N-not like that! Gahh,But don't you seeeee,Nintendo is moving away from family play with this!,We have to use TWO switches to play multiplayer,The same thing Microshat and Shitony doing,Glad to regularly test your sarcasm detector,To make sure it works when it really matters,The only thing Nintendo can truly kill is F Zero,New F Zero game,F Zero foray into the Battle Royale scene,F Zero fans have long awaited a new edition to this series. And we believe this is exactly what they wanted,I actually have no idea what type of game F Zero is,I thought it was racing... But how exactly can F Zero innovate their franchise when it's based on a pretty solid and rigid genre xd,Because all modern racing games like Forza are all the same and generic ,[object Object],Everything will bother long time fans. Screw em. They are old,Baby boomer gamers,Although I can definitely tell Smash Ultimate is trying to draw in the melee fans with some of the older mechanics making a comeback,Ahh. Didn't know that project M kinda flopped a bit with melee fans. Oh well.,Just let them have their fun with an older game. No problem with that at all,Also. With the edition of Smash Supers being faster, I think I would actually turn it on during free for alls,Or just long lasting bullshit to try to evade,I... Was so confused,Then I saw it was a joke lol,It's not!?,What the hell is he talking about then!?,Warp chafe, upflap, dinkout,He's a madman,I own them all,But I suggest Berseria,YES,It's great cause it feels tight and flows well. Plays like Tales of Graces,Then Berseria,Definitely,It's very enjoyable to play~ I hope you enjoy it~,Hint back to my rant on why I chose Berseria over Zestiria,Vice city u mean,Damn. How much tech is in this game,I can't even pull off a footstool,[object Object],Actually. Did one of dedede's air moves change? In the trailer I can see him spin around with his hammer,[object Object],Lolol,I have a feeling Vagrant would do just that too me since I accidentally dash attack when I want to tilt as dedede,Do restaurants around Atlanta even have a banquet room?,I think you mean like a reservable party area?,I like how you disclaimed it as I'm not gay,I'd totally love to see a great plethora of echo character,But... as DLC maybe?,few days of work is like lots of development cost,,ni no kuni 2,pls,perhaps I need to find a King Dedede discord,probably not as popular as falco :>,king dedede meme hellscape sounds fun,,hmmm,wait whose girthquake?,lol,consensus of this discord,they don't like girth,after searching girth,what is this? are we still trying to turn Smash into something that's not a party game ?,Smash Bros vs Capcom,I'm calling it,but I like smash as a platforming fighter,hell,I'd play that,smh, why do i keep running into peoplee I know when I join a discord,Commission Nintendo to have our characters in smash as echo characters,hell. I don't know which character my sona would cosplay as,hell, I'd probably just dedede xd,,so now we can tech grabs?,,err,Tails wouldn't work well with Sonic tho,ew, port priority,definitely THE competitive game to play for Smash,unlike Melee,,uwu,definitely something i'd say,more accurate,nice,holy hell it's so smooth,look at all of that stepping,I'd have to totally lab it,but I've always had problems attacking outta a dash,it comes out as a life ending dash attack for me,which usually ends my miserable existence,hot damn,nice,h y p e,but I liked you using the word amalgamate,Oh snap,I forgot to add em here,Anime hell where I'm the mod,Which I've not had to exercise cause y'all some sweethearts~,Alright, I'mma have to make an example,Stay away rotten meat,You'll contaminate the freshness that is Fluff,I can't see whatever name they are running with now,Not even fulfilling,Possums are ruined for me,You'll see,Kemono Sora,I adore,❤️,He's such a cutey omg,Actually do you think it still might be in the game? Do they usually reveal all the worlds before the game is released,Ehh bakemono sora,I actually want a switch rn,It's only $300,,It's only like one pay check,,You gotta have switch games to populate your list,Actually. I'll wait till there's a Switch + Smash Ultimate edition,No clue. But the game doesn't come out till later so I'll wait for that,Uses it anyway,Oh,Lol,Do they actually check the memory card for game data?,Nice,Same. Actually let's work together to get both of us a switch,We put a small amount of money away then put together to buy you one,Then try to do the same for me but forget and make me all sad,100% RUMBLE INTENSITY,I kinda never played metal gear solid,Only like the intro to V,Wait. Doesn't V have multiple games?,Phantom Pain then,Metal gear rising?,Leave it to the MGS pros here,Strip more into military fighting gear bby,Gosh. That sounds great,S I g h,Redownload's MSGV,I like NieR Automata cause of the interactive storytelling. It weaved plot progression and character motives into gameplay,So death standing might be my kinda game too,Beyond two souls,Can it?,All races feel the same,I don't think I quite understand...,Perhaps you say that the difference between vehicles create the implied narrative?,Or dark souls?,Shit car,Call them Interactive games. I mean Telltale games are still games afterall,Do gamers really hate them?,I'll call u an interactive media,Hey. We aren't talking about Shadow of the Collosus,I did call death stranding a walking simulator too lol,I don't mind walking simulators unless I really get some action or really enthralling narrative,[object Object],I feel like this was a good thing I liked about NieR where this boss was furthering the plot while giving you gameplay at the same time. You don't actually have to fight the boss,Just something to do while you heighten the progression of the game,Nope. Not trash taste. I particularly got really slightly confused cause I was watching the trailer for Deaths Stranding and was like how's the gameplay like amongst all the dialouge and cutscenes and walking,I think it might be a stealth horror?,But like not really?,I feel like I should know what you mean by this,Taking a byte count and dividing by 1024...,Don't you mean... Multiplying by 1024 then?,Wait... Gahh,1024 Bytes is 1KB,1024KB is 1MB,Oh,,MiBs,Bby,Mb vs MB,I don't know the difference actually,There we go,This is exactly what we do,Meanwhile I'm trying to figure out why a variable I have is a comma separated string when I thought it was an array of values,JavaScript. And I saw my problem. I'd didn't actually convert my string to an array when I returned it from a function specifically made to convert string to array,Spent way too much time cleaning the data set than actually doing what I wanted it to do,Lol,I like my modulation ok,This is exactly what I forgot to do,Fixed~,Btw. I just modulated my cleaning and conversion to array so that my main program looks easier to follow,H e y,A fur coating?,Seems nice really,[object Object], Soo next meet. Been too long,Husky has it worse,Poor Akio-senpai,Yeah. We'd have a play day of 8 player smash,Let's schedule it so that this boi can come,N o p e,Not for me at least,I gotta hang out with Mettsu before he leaves too,Meets at Kyris' house twice a month seemingly lol. One for weebs and one for normies,That's 24 meets a year,Yeah. Can be quite difficult to plan it,Y u s,If only we can karoke Aggretsuko quips,,Wait,In 1v1 the smash ball stays grounded?,Looks like they want to have viable supers in for glory,Yes actually,I mean they aren't cancer you mean,H e y. Final smashes are a thing in the game,Dammit,I wanna switch,For this GAME,Ok,I did tho lol,What's F zero?,Yoshi is from Super Mario Bros,,,This sticker pack,Were those not techable before?,lolol,KORE DE OWARI DA!,[object Object],look at this sexy dedede,with extreme high rez,,Nvidia Hairworks ™,,Ryu also looks much better than he did in SFV. why didn't SFV look like this again?,,look at them toes,n-noooooo,I just like how much detail they put into these models even though we won't see much of their work up close,[object Object],smash ultimate changes that are speculated or confirmed,I think by grabbing at the same frame as someone else,prior it was decided by port priority I think?,no clue unless I seee video of it,ikr,now my question stands why doesn't Street Fighter V looks like this,Hey furries. Press news,Wolf isn't bi,,W r o n g,Ur a 0,I'd think he'd want to pound ass,Idk. Just me,I mean we are putting sexualities onto a fictional character that has not once canonical shown any romantic or sexual interest,Damn that's cool,I assume only one arrow on the ground at once?,Pair him with only fox,I mean the pair is hot,Ngl,Nothing much. Just still figuring out new tech in the game,Like this,Which is pretty cool,How can it be used viably tho,Unless getting two arrows increased knockback by twice,In crysis,[object Object],All I hear is that I have a 50% base chance,They'll be too busy playing with one hand,Yeah. Furries can't handle themselves when they've have quality time with them and Wolf,Smash Ultimate,How many more internet points till I can cash in a prize?,Time to farm those points by reposting,If I get JubGold on a post do I automatically win a prize?,How'd I get three?,o,Gotta blast,Dec,Hell ya,There's no spoilers lol. We are all excited for the gameplay and changes from other smash games,Not like there's a story mode,I hope there is tho,From what I see they took E3 as a chance to get people really hype for the game which is basically finished if they release it now. They had an entire tournament to gather data on professional players seemingly to make the game more balanced at top play before the game comes out.,I'M EXCITED AND I DON'T OWN A Switch,>w>,[object Object],this should be illegal,timestamped Ridley Down-B sweetspot to Smash True Combo killl,yeah, it does like 52% on a mario at 0%,only if you sweet spot it tho,the sweetspot is bigger when not 1v1 ?,I thought I heard that from an official source on stream,I took the sarcasm. was pretty apparent,lolol,got em,SERAPHIC STAR~,ikr, that was smooth,ridley is hot tho,lol,when I was younger and playing Halo 2, I took a good look at Arbiters mandibles and thought man... what could he do with those mandibles,must have shaped who am I today,searching up arbiter on the internet mann,crap changes you,went from arbiter to... liking monsters in general,monsters got really ... sexy for me,err,Jackals?,also...,,this monster in the Jaberwock ALSO woken something,man. what a series of unfortunate events,now I'm a menace to society,the food chain: Nova > Monsters > Prey,so much r34 of anything that wasn't human,rip me,i wanna hug and pet monstas too,this is significantly diffeerent than me wanting Ridley to pick me up and drag me across the wall like he did samus,The flood actually scared me back then,Till uhh,They became nice to look at,planning on this maybe?,Yesss,did... scylla ever look like that,wait,ehhh,ohh,now that's what I remember,the heck is this lol,lolol,they were so unlocalized I haven't even heard of those games,I've... regrettably not played a single dragon quest game,yeah, I've played lots of Final Fantasy, MegaTen, Tales of,although not Dragon Quest,a bit of 4 tho,so for real for real,why did the Wii U fail but the Switch didn't?,actually you talking about the Wii U prompted my question ,[object Object],just a disclaimer,I'm like actually staring at this chat,Scared to go to bed if someone decided to muck it up with actual lewdness,Cause I enforce PG13,We got anime girls in here man,You could always do that in a r18 chat,I am in bed,I'm in your bed,,You really shouldn't,That's cursed,Yes,You are actually,This would make me really happy tbh,Hentai,,Oh damn,Nice,Look. Furries are a small world you know smh,I'm on the 21rst,It's fine tho,Cause like the people I went to their party with aren't coming to this weeb meet,There's not a competition.

I sported pretty good oppai when I was over Kyris' place,Lolol,I had a Japanese person play with my oppai too at Kyris' place,Yep,VR is the future,We become anime girls,Check out ,[object Object],’s Tweet: ,[object Object],,Kirby can intake all projectiles. If that's true along with Dedede being about to intake his gordo,Whose to say mah boi dedede can't succ up more projectiles,Come at me bro. I'll beat you with my gordo and succ it up to do it again,Well yes,He will,I mean nothing really changes. It's kinda annoyinggg,Just flip or color palette change,why is it so low quality,did you take a picture of it using your phone?,marths grab,Soo much range,So good,You can cancel it what?,That's styling lol,If you land it. Damn you deserve that spike,Uhh,I didn't see the cancel,It must be really subtle,Really?,Hmm,Alright. He landed the spike on falcon and landed and did it again. Do you mean he's canceling the landing lag by pressing upB before hitting the ground?,Ohhhhhh,FALCON was cancelling,Not Ganon,It's a defensive option,I really know nothing about pichu lol,Tilt them to get hit by it again?,Lol,L-cancelling?,Ohh,You all taught me that lol,(still can't do it lol),Yeah. Like me a new player,I don't actually own a smash game lol,I don't know anything about smash uwu,n o,Why,Did you do this,I'll watch this unfold,lolol,So are we calling this Smash U or Smash4U?,Smash U dammit,What about Dedede's crouch taunt? It's great,The best taunt in the game,You can cancel his taunt into anything,Lolol,Welcome~,I could use fresh meat rn,I'm hungery and it's actually almost time for lunchs,Love u too Xenos,Don't you mean STEAK?,Is anyone not questioning this,Skippyvee~,thats pretty narrow,I'm the other person that's saying "smash isn't a fighting game",I mean he pretty much won the argument,I suck at melee cause King Dedede isn't in it,Lolol,Also known as the Smash Bros Killer,Infinitely better than smash Bros in any way shape and form,I was gonna disagree. But like damn ur right,But he does SUCK in every game though,There can't be a game with Kirby in it that doesn't suck,It's what he does,,Just got 2/8 this morning,Oh wait. I need to add the artist name in it,Artist is ,[object Object], same artist that helped designed my sona years ago,Apparently doesn't add reference cards in ANY of his sticker packs lol,I got a friend discount lol.

Sorry furs. He's not bi,,Only a couple really,Nope. I would like to fall asleep again as well,Likewise,Only when i finally get stuff completed  after solving errors,Right now I'm learning how to use Fastify for NodeJS.,,Lolol,It's riling me up looking at him go,Marketed towards furries,Especially the teeth,I fanboyd,Final smash you mean? I know they quickened everyone's up alot,Yeah flip the tank,They act more synonymous to supers in fighting games. It's a really powerful attack that won't kill at low percent and isn't a evade for x amount of seconds,Which I think I would put smash ball back into 1v1 now,Or in general,King dedede final smash is pretty cool hehe,2,Oh wait,1,I didn't see the Zangoose towards the front,Then I saw what made it better,L o o k,It's cool k,I wanna ride a bike,Just no bike,Buy 👀,Didja size me up while we were hanging out!? How direct of you!?,What's an inseam,I actually don't bike so I've no clue. I mean I bet I could use Tate's bike without a problem,Doooo it,Hmm. I have no clue,Did you train it for 252 EVs for Attack? I'm not sure if it applies upon level up?,Hmm weird,Did it actually get +20 when you look in status to see if it's just a glitch?,Huh,Weird,Nature shouldn't have anything to do with it either hmm,With level up bonus I mean,I'm aware of natures~ it's good,I have a competitive team but not facing Akio with it,I also thought about building another one but I didn't even finish UM,Like Akio,I love incieneroar,Although. Lots of Alolan Pokemon are slowww,Slower compared to other gens,Use tags to tag ur eggs,I had a PC box called the yiff chamber,Which.. was a box specifically dedicated to holding breeding parents,H e y. I got lots of use outta my 4 perfect IV ditto mkay,Craps kinky man,I wanna play another Mystery Dungeon gahhh,Ohhh,I remember that one,Gates to infinity?,That sounds newww,Woah. My dreams,Do you really? I love his design and rubbing that manly chest of his~ haha hehehe~❤️,Just take a hit and then kill the opposition,He'll get outsped anyways lol,Well. That really depends if you are going 252Atk/252HP or 252atk/252sp.atk,Talking about all of this is making me miss using my mega evo Lucario 252atk252speed,Wrecked battle tree with that monster,^,But probably means he's gonna go with,Darkest Lariat definitely. Ur bad if u don't,Earthquake?,Doesn't that lock you?,Actually. With a moveset like this... Let's choice band him,Basically increases attack but locks you into one move,Sounds bad at first. But then nothing sounds bad when the enemy is faint amirite?,Choice items are really really good for sweeps,Ehh. Flare Blitz causes recoil so a fall back like Fire Fang helps,It also gets STAB so I think it fits,FIRE STAB pls,What would you replace Fire Fang with.,Personally. I'd slap on Shadow Claw,I actually thought about this question to but I rationalized it,Actually not bad,Well yeah if he's specialize in atk,Oh my godddd,Gloryyyy haha,Tate. I kinda wanna trade u my Lucario,Shiny obviously gains extra stats,Yours beat mine lol,Beio. Square up in RU doubles,Lolol,I wanna be in pajamas now,I've a lot of thoughts in my head but sometimes the output doesn't quite relate with the topic,,,Paper Mario is an Italian RPG uwu,Not a Japanese RPG,On GTS,Damnit. I wanted to make a joke of how useless GTS is,Most trades were for impossible things to get,Most of it last time I checked was LEGENDARY POKEMON BELOW LEVEL 10 pls,That's a thing now?,Great,Last time I touched GTS was Gen 5 lol,Why feebas so popular,Dunsparce op in RU,this is me right now,I walked home 45 mins today from work,this is also me,right now,where's your SHINY,sigh,pulling out my 3DS,,,here's my lucarioo,it's cracked and broken,mainly the reason I don't play on my 3DS much anymore,idk what happened, just happened,I can,but I'll just get a switch,I should probably sell my games to someone tbh,Pokemon Black
Pokemon Moon
Pokemon Ultra Moon
Shin Megami Tensei IV
Persona Q: Shadow of the Labryinth
Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright (bought other two routes by dlc)
Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia,yes, they are all japanese rpgs,you really wanna buy my pokemon games?,what so that I can finish the game?,how about do it on the Pokemon 2019 game,I'll keep my games for now, probably just get a new 2ds and finish my games at some point,why do you have an "old" 3ds,I've not been playing the 3DS much anyway so it'll be fine,That's exactly thee model I have lol,oh no wait, I have new 3ds xl,what a champ,,like I thought, I love the yin-yang between your two sonas,it's glorious,but you'd urp it up,that's why I switched from 2 to 1 earlier,I noticed what you were going for,don't compare me to him! I'm not a wanna be pokemon,,Battle Frontier in Emerald I think was the best after game,lol, but is Battle Frontier in either one of them?,awww. it's the greatest after game everrrr,alright, what's the best overall post game?,otheer than Battle Frontier?,I mean I'd have to agreee,there's the entire kanto region,YES,I'm not the only one,Can I stay just a bit longer?~ I really like it up here,I wouldn't dare defile your perfectness,,Its not (what's in quotation marks),That's the localized version,Probably better than me tbh,I can't seem to get back into studying nihongo again,Yeah. I know my goal was get fluent in Japanese but I somehow lost my motivation,Every single time I try to get to study, I grow drowzy,Problem with practicing with you is that I don't know enough context heavy vocabulary to keep up a topic through speech.,So I choke up really hard when I don't know something,I barely knew what foods were in Japanese,Exactlyyyy,I got the tools just keep feeling drowsy every time I start,I have Genki 1 and Genki 2. Both with workbooks. Along with Tobira 1 (which I'll probably not touch). Even with Wanikani to help me with Kanji using it's SRS system. And Jisho to break apart sentences into words and parts rather than direct translation,All of these and mannnn. My school study woes are also killing me,Oh. And Japanese From Zero 1 as well. Since George Trombley built a pretty fun community around it,I'm a terrible student and it reflects in my personal studies too,I've been picking up Japanese that way as well. I've fallen off on translating doujinshi too,I want to finish translating that Charizard x Lugia doujin I was translating too,... wow. Read them without hesitation,I'll give it a honest try later today after work,I watched the first two minutes of it and caught at least the gist of the sentences. It's pretty low level vocabulary indeed,,It's not rezero,But I agree,*cough*,I don't blame you. They both start with Zero,And has furries in their world,Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho,One thing about Re:Zero that I wish could be better. Is have more screen time for the kemonojin in the world,Like all the main cast are human and human like demons,Im glad the captain wuff dude got screen time,I've tried watching the first episode of the second season but uhh.,Stopped. Like so many political rundown at the beginning almost made me stop to rewatch the first season to get a grasp,They totally ended it openly,Should have a season 2. But I don't know if they really should,I feel like all loose ends were tied up at the end. So it's good to stop there,Twin brother?,Woah,Kawaiiii,can confirm,,Broke link,Just like melee,Lololol,,Lolol,Erm. It's Gabshiba,Just wait till this next peice,Steam sale is coming. Gabe pls have mercy on my wallet. I'm strong! Even though I have things on my wishlist I must stay strong,Big problem of mine,I have a rather large library of games I've yet to finish,I'm doing a second run through of Dark souls 3 instead of finishing my current installed games of Divinity Original Sin 2, Ni No Kuni 2, Nioh,Boi,Send help,Also. I legit need a friend for the Valley of Irathyll. I actually can't do it with my current build lol. Tanky big hitty Bois can't deal with quicky attacky bois,Disclaimer. You just taught me something about wolf,I actually have no idea what's games he's from and what's his plot and relation to fox,The only star fox games I played was Adventure and Assault,Gotcha,You see. I went to go look around for more NieR Automata fan canon but like most of it is sex,I just want more of the universe dammit,,My wallpaper is set for now,Oh. Cancelled star fox 2?,People were attracted to Krystal for some reason when I was attracted to Fox,Fox > Krystal,Why does everyone know about Miyu and Fat except me,Good to see Beio picking up ur slack,You drive a pretty good point,What's F Zero?

I just remember him as ness. Wait,The protag of mother 1 is ninten not ness?,Weird. I thought Mother 1 came to us known as Earthbound,L o o k,I just woke up,That's a thing?,Ok,Rip,I'm noob. I know. I didn't actually like earthbound the first 3 hours of the game,*Google's Galacta Knight*,Basically meta knight,Is there really any character that would fit dedede to echo?,He's unique,Yes pls,Waluigi echo for Luigi?,I wonder how many echo characters they'll put in the game,wish I could sleep the whole day,the only game I'm probably get for the Steam Summer Sale is Wizard of Legend. tho could use another controller,That's my first thought too lol,Also. When r we gonna hang out,It's because we are connected spiritually. Soul mate I believe is the term~,Touché,We'll collaborate eventually,Great. Now how about rule 34 of these characters,Likewise. These characters really do show their personality, even with a 2D 1 frame image. If only I could do the same with my art,U r nice,All three posts,I was 10,Oh man. Been a while since I've played MKX,*teleports*,Drakenguard 3,Otw,Yes,Check out ,[object Object],’s Tweet: ,[object Object],,[object Object],It's not happening today,There's no meet today at all.

Just haven't sat down to enjoy any of it,I'm currently playing through Ni No Kuni 2 right now. After that I'll probably go back to finish Tales of Symphonia. I kinda take my time with that one since I put it in Japanese audio and close my eyes to listen to Japanese,I'll watch it with you~,At some point I have to finish Final Fantasy 15... But like I need 16GB RAM to fully appreciate the new assets,Actually I know how that feels. Upon waking up you check telegram and reply,Then fall asleep again,Mario Tennis Aces is really fun btw. I recommend the game,Oh snap,I forgot that was today,I'm interested in rise of tomb raider speed run,Games Done Quick,It's a multi day speed run event,Played it over ,[object Object], along with ,[object Object],So it's basically a fighting game,While there are 6/6 win condition or regular tennis win condition, you can break an opponent's raquet using Zone Shots or Special Shots. So the game ends up being destroy the enemies raquet to win.,Stamina meter too,It was just me and Kyris. Beio was third wheel,,I love u more,Whenever I bother Kyris to come over it ends up being a small get together.,You should run into me,Sometimes u no,He's raising his burbs. They'll leave the nest soon,Sure. 1v1 is more fun than 2v2,But that's cause I main Bowser,Same. My username used to be Maximizedgamer,We have a satellite Armello group,Basically a chat where people talk about armello then @ people when you want a game,Some of us are in that chat actually,Main meets in Atlantic Station.

How'd I miss this games announcement?,*facepalm*,I forgot about it,y e e s h. my vocabulary is stil lacking. trying my best to understand at least the gist of what they are saying,alright, I'd probably have to say like 60% of words I don't know? I can follow kinda, but when they say a word I kinda know, my mind kinda gets stuck on that word then I end up missing the rest of the sentence,oof,oh nooo,60% of words I DO know,I'll... keep going,I've Jisho to the side when I caught a word that I want to know and figured it's pretty hella important as a keyword,perhaps I should try getting up a script myself. after watching the OVA in it's entirety first tho,a japanese script first. then try to translate it myself to English, then we can compare Akio-senpai,Vagrant-sannnnnn,oh snap. are you using TensorFlow?,lolol,same,what would you suggest I do Akio-senpai? should I try to go straight to an english translation? or do what I'm doing and try to get myself a script first then translate?,hot damn this is GOOD,favoriteed it on soundcloud,I'll follow u anywhere,,I probably should watch,Oof. I don't actually like Shounen,Last anime I watched seriously from start to finish was Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho,Screw it. I'mma seriously watch an anime. Can't call me a weeb without more anime on me,I mean it comes with ur tastes,You like trashy shitty anime so you get trashy shitty anime,Exactly how I watched Hand Shakers,G a h,I'll watch first episode tonight before bed,Boku no hero academia,Just finished first episode. Set ups pretty good,I loved that anime. A great mix of both comedy and plot,They aren't wrong,not again,You'd think they'd learn that by having an animal animated mascot they'll get ruined by furries,13 hits on e621,...,3 of them have Zabivaka,there's a version of this with her clothes off,actually. there's one 8 dayss before today,sos maybe peoplle knew about her prior?,... but I prefer pulp,The comment section for that PUBG one lol,Like. I HAVE pubg. But like it's super buggy and unoptimized,No wonder they lost so many players,Absolutely not,The game runs like garbage. Granted the update did help alot of the crashing,Fortnite is better in every way shape and form,It's also free,Lool,I'd play that,Your avatar is cursed,Chrome://inspect is oddly niche greatness,I think I prefer more players on a map. But those games would make it quicker,N o,Yes pls,I actually want that now lol,!,Oh wait right. Can't buy it,,Doing the turtling thing to save money,I only bought wizard of legend,No moreeee,I have some idea at the back of my mind that I'm being shipped with a purple bear by a boat,Will you blackmail the studio to make sure your ship happens?,0 to death combo on Marius,So this is what we are gonna do. Im gonna get a ship. And put both ,[object Object], and me on the ship.,It's called shipping,Then we'll even have a badger dog bear hybrid child,Don't see much goose sona now that I think about it,Oh right,Geese are assholes,My school has geese and ducks that live on campus,When they have children they pretty much attack the University students lol,Eagdearse,Eagle deer horse hybrid,I don't actually get it lol,Don't say anymore,Omg no pls,Admittedly, I've not played gta,This is the most devious way to make money,I now imagine a movie where fires keep popping up and the firefighters set them ablaze to put them out for more fame and income,Cursed,Shiji is a special reshiwam,Do nut steal,I mean. It's was pretty clean entry,She's obviously has done this before to be so loose,,Nothing in news about it tho,Slip the article to us like I slip right into your dms,Article posted a year ago.,Hmmm,If y'all don't stop,You know. No one has actually mentioned anything about this. But what should we call you? I've been saying S n X Boi in my mind,Oh right. Your sona name!,How about Husbando,Saved,Xion-san,You've now been touched by Nova's weebspeak,II,II,I_,That too but mostly weebs,Synonymous,I actually really like your taste in music. You are actually sending help from me constantly listening to video game ost,My SoundCloud is super old tho. Still using a very old avatar,,すごい音楽な,Reminds me of High Lord Wolnir,Yet,Everything that lives is designed to end. We are trapped in a never-ending cycle is life and death. Is this a curse? Is this a punishment? I often think about the god that blessed us with this cryptic puzzle... So that one day we might kill him,We totally should meet to listen to your music and chill out together.,,How are you doing now?,Better than super ow?,Or just ow?,Thanos can kill with a snap?,I've yet to watch the movie soooo,It's long past spoiler protection,So just lay it on me lol,Everytime I tried. Plans got ruined,When I went to the movies with Tate, I figured we should watch something we've both not watched,It might as well have been a date lol,Ahh. That totally makes sense!,Reminds me of Akame ga Kill,Mannn. Having practically everyone you enjoy die sucks,Madoka Magica is a horrible anime,It shouldn't even be anime,Cause it's good,Kawaiiiii,We are blasting off again!!!!!!,Yeah. That was my gripe too,But when they look awesome and different it's great,Oof,Lolll,I'm still a fan of Leauge. Just rather not play it lol,I mean... Till they fix clash,I'd jump on for Clash. It's super exciting only,Yeah. That's a huge part. Matches can get longggg,Like a full game can take 40 mins to reach late game,Still shorter than a game of TantoCuore ,[object Object],,I'm having a decent day. Much better than yesterday,took a while for these game selection to come out,like. I don't have a justification for getting a wee yuuu,but I have justification for getting a Switch,^,it's not a terrible system, just wasn't a great as it could have been. so of coursse you would still haave a great time with the system. although this fun was limited for the lifespan of the console because of these things that held it back,I also enjoyed the Wii U,(as a smash machine uwu),i called it a smash machine,but I never owned the console,my opinion isn't as good as yours uwu,I need new backgrounds for my computer. it's been Persona for the longest,I want some good 1920x1080 wallpapers,oh, where are you moving to?,alright, I'm free saturday to come help. but (granted much help is based on whether or not I have a ride),why would I do that?,did they bring back clash?,I'll reinstall the game when they announce clash is coming back,transfering data from old phone to replacement phone,alright that's actually fun,I don't get what it is about my group. they just don't like anything that's not competitive summoners rift,they complain about eveerything else lol,but then I'd have to reinsstall league,I've uninstalled it like 5 times since I stopped playing,mostly cause my brother use my comptuer when I'm gone for days at a time,n o,it'll only make me wanna play the game,uhh...,ermmm....,Dark Souls 3 and Ni No Kuni 2 for now. I downloaded Smite to play with ,[object Object], but he's so busyyyy,cursed,yes it's bad,I shouldn't play league because I don't wanna play it anymore,I gotta jump on top of that,Morning~,Nope. Mom woke me up at 5,,It's time I revealed the truth to you. We went to same high school. I wanted u to notice me senpai,,Can't tell if you caught my lie or not lol,Trashy Poverished Morrow High School,Who says they are diverse when 90% of the school population is black,Pretty sure high school was the worst time of my life,Not questioning his other avatars in the past?,Well yeah. Nuggets don't have rights,I'm a tender enthusiast thank you,Tenders are better,That's not a breaded chicken product,This is cursed,O_o,I'm on the case,Comic name ヒトで,ぬくい,おやすみ,Actually these seem like mini comics,Grammar I don't know oof,Jisho,... wouldn't that be 食べった then?,Teach me senpai,The difference,,Hmmmmm. That means I'll have to study Auxillary verbs,It's probably that easy but I wanna see how the verb changes as we add it. Will help me in the future.,Soo...,By adding ちゃう to 食べった 「食べちゃった」 would change the meaning of the verb from Ate to Ate completely?,We know you are,,It's ichidan. Right,You just reminded me,But yeah,Alright.... Let me give this a spin,酒を飲みちゃったな,... when my coworkers are talking about Aggretsuko,,The star is where the verb goes right?,Obviously,So we use the ってform of the verb as well.,Oh right yeah,So... Using this....,酒を飲みったちゃう,godan,,oof,I may have forgotten... Its one of the first things I learned.. in my notes somewhere,Great.

He's a Nova Husbando,lol,oh, I heard about something llike this,lol,your avatar 👌,Nice.

I miss SMT,I wanna play more,I need to play more Nocturne,But man,Game makes me wanna kms,I am,I'm jumping right in on that,The poison lakes in smt games,CANCER,YESS,a huge reason im planning on getting the switch,Holy shitt,SMT4 was definitely kinda persona ish,I need more dark toned games,Alright. I'm gonna play Nocturne again,Die,Quite. It was more smt than fire emblem,The only thing they really added from FE was the weapon triangle and character classes,That's fantastic to my ears,... although I do like Tokyo Mirage Sessions ost tho,devil survivor is my jam,Actually my first smt game,Was devil survivor,I want the game. But ehh. 3DS isn't looking good,I need to buy a new 2DS,You know in Russia,Oh wait,Not sure. Maybe the IOS thing?,They are really all for security and being the most secure platform,Kinda like those Linux hipsters who use Kali over anything else,VR chat while tipsy,Oh icons?,That's a bummer,They are echo fighters,Lolol,Yooooo awesomeee,Any art of Breeze that doesn't have a cig isn't AUTHENTIC,Omgggg,I love their suits of Zangoose and another Pokemon I don't know the name of,Bless you,[object Object],My favorite artist null-ghost :(,[object Object],He got rid of his profile picture, removed his profile, and set his name to nothing. Then he tweeted out 沒有什麼人可以信任的 which basically means "I can't trust anyone",Dang. I wanna redownload The Evil Within 2 again,I can't play horror games at all but like THIS GAME IS ASTOUNDING,It's so good. I just get too frightened easily,Nice new avatar btw,I could totally do it too. Problem is I'll be pretty scared playing it lol,,Freaking hell,Outlast,You think the evil within scared me,You should have seen what Outlast did to me,My brother dared me ;-;,Needlessly to say I broke my headset wire when I jumped out of my seat,Lolol,I can't handle horror at all... I know...,I was kinda doing it in Resident Evil 7 and Alien Isolation,RE6... Wasn't even horror lol,RE7 tho hope my,RE6 is practically an action game,I own all of these horror games cause my brother loves the hell outta them,But they are all racing games,Needs a,Battle Royale mode,afternooooooooon,no work today,so I'm home playing Smite,did I get god rank 1 with him yet... don't remember..,yes I would enjoy a friend to play with after this joust,kk,by turtle eggman you mean Kuzenbo?,,hes a b i g,b o i,I've not seen a single thing,until NOW,I've also not seen much of Camazotz,I've not seen much of such natured things of smite,except fenrir,d e f i n i t e l y,anubis uwu,Lol. Good boys are allowed xd,I really liked World Trigger. I liked the fact that the main character was actually extremely weak and has to use tactics to overcome his battles than sheer strength. The manga artist put the series on haitus due to health problems that hospitalized him,Wow,That's hard,All I did was play JRPG's on ps2,Secret Agent Clank?,Action Japanese rpgs,Which.. still are jrpgs lol,Jesus that defense that Goichi has,Where down south though,Nice,[object Object],,I'm going back to sleep xd,PC Gamer: Monster Hunter World PC release info is coming next week.
,[object Object],give me a second,AAHHHHHHHHHHHH HYPEEEEEEEEE,Osmosis Jones is an anime,Change my mind,,I did,I added him but he accidentally left,Their TV's were okay. Nothing notable,I live and breathe furry. I'm the ultimate trash,I can't ever leave thee fandom. it's like leaving life.,I'm playing Tokyo After school Summoners and I finally got enough stones to do a 10x roll. I thought this game would only have husbandos for me but I think I can make an exception,,Hakumen,Her Ojou-sama laugh gives me life,Good thing Nintendo is reselling them for $30,It's what I'm gonna do,What's that?,,This game. Was made for me,I can't NOT choose the third option every time,I suppose I AM the game's target demographic lol,Actually. You are right. I'm not sure why I'm still into this game after three days,I suppose it's a nice break from FGO atm (even though there's a large farming AP down Success Rate Up period that I should be doing),It's a vastly different game,Shadowverse is a card game while FGO is a Gacha Waifu Simulator,Except Hearthstone is better,to get a response outta you,Shadowverse is better imo,holy shit,that's awesome,what's the enchanced version,SHOW ME,helllll yaaa,,I need this as a sticker,you just completely ruined my sticker. it's not enough to be completely misinformed,ur just misguided,xd,it was a joke that I made xd,what about bara characters dressed in butler attire?,that works,Madoka is marketed towardss children,I read this as Sex Fox Assult,Adventure and Assault weere the only Star Fox gamess I played,I would like to see Assault be done again,did I hear,Star Fox Assault Battle Royale,the party at the beginning of the match votes on a Ultimate,holy flip this reminds me of breeze,Exactly how you should play fighting games casually,You find someone you like and you play the hell outta them,The only ones who care about teir lists are competitive nuts,Isn't wavedashing just a bug in the game?,Lol,Ohh. Ok,Is that why wavedashing is totally there in Ultimate as a mechanic,Actually... What makes the new parry mechanic a parry? Does it frame 1 remove all shield stun for you to attack?,The later is TOTALLY more important,... holy flip,After reading input buffering in fighting games,I actually just found out how this useless state machine thing I learned is actually implemented in fighting games with input buffer,I.. fell asleep alot during class so I kinda don't know much but it makes sense,I'll get back to this topic after I take the next part of this course called Theory of Computation this fall,I forgot what l cancelling is again,Stupid,Not my count,You shouldn't agree,I'd like the using of CC to pause the frame for a little while to dramatize the effect and give a slightly bit of time to buffer what your canceling into,Let's also charge CC by taking damage as well since it seems we can use it as a pressure breaker too,The system does seem to reward very aggressive gameplay,Or else you get brawlhalla previously where being super defensive and sharking the stage was more rewarding than actually fighting your opponent head on,God Ranked was such cancer with these dodging hit and run players,,...,I'm more interested now,Already,Damnit,Yeah. This freaking anime,Like fail so bad trying to be innovative in their shots,Yeah. I watched this whole anime btw,It was on a dare cause my friends watched the first scene and was like NOPE,I went in thinking it'll redeem itself to be something decent,But NO,I hated myself,alright, my artist threw in an extra sticker for me since he took so long with them,I'm wondering what type of sticker I should get,[object Object],YOU GOT EM,,Rip,Actually Akio would have destroyed most of  us,His actually really good at smash, I can barely get anything off on him,I was about to say yeah he didn't go to any of Kyris after-party,Omni?,Omni plays a LOT of melee,actually.,yes,well. are you going to feed ur dog?,ooooooooooo,The Last of Us Remastered is AWESOMEEEEe,he's a great boyfriend uwu,ps2 slim adapter right?,I can't bring it to you lol,I'm legit stuck here,,I'd love to come over again!,,h a w t,it's fine, PG13 we can talk about stuff likee this but no actually NSFW content shown,but please continue to wuff at me more in pms uwu,ewww,ehhh, a bit too suggestive,It's a great photo tho,sorry, deefinitely too suggestive,*saved it tho*,uwu,check audit logs,slide right into those dms uwu,Phew. That's a super longshot,oh damn, you watched good stuff,I agree, I've reached the 9th episode and I'm enjoying it,Boku no Hero Academia,oh, I recommend Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood,that's my favorite anime,I'm not much of a shonen fan,but FMA is really good,then it can wait for tomorrow,hit me up in a real mans game,like YUGIOH,I probably do need to pick up the Remastered version. I mean like... Dark Souls 3 is my favorite one in the series,especially Faith's region,I punched a box of Bliss to get there,that was a heck of a trip,the only time I'd actually prefer dubbed is when the subtitles are localized HEAVILY so I get disparity from the tidbits of japanese I hear and what the subtitles say,for example: Ni No Kuni 2,literally EVERY CHARACTERS NAME HAS BEEN CHANGED,2 no ku2 2,lol beautiful,yes pls uwu,actually not really,Lolol,You stretched that 9 a bit hard but lol,Ni no Kyuuni,Are we RP old Japanese people,Please 死 me, I'm 苦,,I'm the physical manifestation of sadness,Until we add suru to the end of a word. We can change any noun into a verb!,Ore wa Kyris suru,OMG lol,My ears when I'm listening to Persona 5 dub say a couple of Japanese names,OH MY GOOOOOD,Long time ago,Oh jeez,I can't read handwritten Japanese lol,Because all his movies aren't canon,I'M DOWN,Time & Date and I'm fuckin there,My dad loves dbz and he's 45,But we are also fashionably lazy,Can this be hentai pls,Ok I deserve that,But like really tho,I have a thing for goo monsters that underrepresented,Lolol,Like smash 4?,When I get the game, I'm totally playing more Empoleon,yeah I have no clue how this power system works anymore,,planned in august,,L a m e,[object Object],I AM ZIMMMMM,EXCITE,[object Object],It's coming~,I'm not sure I like Tulip's slightly new design. I hope she's just as espression filled as the mini clip,I saw that lol,it was great,b o i,You see. Kimahri is life and love,But my true crush in FFX,Was Bahamut,Very delicate thing.,This is definitely a safe space,A safer place is in my embrace,,I thought,I already sent it to you tho,*loading PM cannon*,*unloads*,uwu,,,I now want gummy bears,[object Object],Pump It Up is an Arcade Dance game. I played it with Kyris at Round 1 last Saturday,Yeah, but has five pads instead of 4,The corners and middle,A whole new meaning to eat a dick,Yes,I like Round 1 more than Dave & Buster's,An arcade that has Japanese import games. It's located in Southcrest Mall in Lithonia,Band-aid,Which unfortunately didn't get a chance to play,@ me when dnb gets Fate Grand Order Arcade,I play Tekken,Well kinda,I've been meaning to get to redownload it,Claudio and Lee main hereeee,Bet it's lucky chloe,... what's that doujin I read where anime girls were being born from boobs...,lol, it's not that bad, he just have to take off his shirt, and take off his bag,show his beautiful body out to the world,,HELL YAAAA,,Downloading this now,,Has an AR mode. Would be pretty interesting if I could battle other players but in AR,does it!?,a w w,AR PVP would be hella lit,or you know,Switch Pokemon AR Local Battles,uwu,wait what it doesn't!?,awww,I mean then again a camera can come as an attachment,for AR,I mean I thik the good thing is that by taking the camera outa of the switch and having a dedicated camera add on means the camera can be goooood,and definitely keep the switch price down thanks pls,the switch is bulky?,I wonder if downloading the full game can make the game run smoother,The animations and graphics are really top notch on high,Actually. These are the models that are gonna be used in SMTV right?,I'll do that too,Can confirm. Game runs smoother,Gimmie ur fc,Actually I've no idea what it's called but give it to me,NANI!?,Sent Request. Markcus is the name,I mean I didn't change it,And I JUST STARTED LOL,I can't even change it right now lol,I think,Haven't unlocked that functionality,Literally F-Zero anything,Yeah. Megakin...,Ow that line,yes,I thought you played Persona 5?,oh wait,I confused myself,pls disregard,I used too,heard the editor commited suicide,,AYYYY,I AM ZIMMMM,you have mistaken,I played all thre,yeah I bought all three,y e ssssss,currently the one I'm following is Kemo Coliseium,,Not that I know of,,Kemono,Yes,You mean a GOOD ONE?,cause those don't exist,Your standards are pretty high,It just means you have trash tastes,Doesn't mean you're standards are low,Not quite,I have low standards with a great taste,lol, there's an argument in channel 1 about SMT vs Persona,oml,Koro-chan wins hands down,I need to play The Answer again in P3FES,I didn't finish it cause I lost my save file,you've got a cute personality too,,,Found this cool wallpaper of Velvet when using Variety (a program that automatically downloads wallpapers from a source and changes your wallpaper),Linux only though,Program,I love Velvet. She's such a great and edgy character uwu,Wait what,You weren't in here?,,Ahh. Alright,,I don't think you are a problem starter but if you think it was a good idea to leave it be then I'm behind you on that decision,,Gc controllers are generally alright,You don't need specific smash controllers,Afternoon Zangy-san~,,Ahh. I'm just spending the weekend over a friend's placeee,,Oml I hope she's ok,Yokattaaa,Yeah pretty much,,Finally went back to finish the super boss of Tales of Zestiria,22 minutes on simple mode,It's just a fucking health sponge,That's it,The funny thing is. On the harder difficulties. It just has more health. Fighting Zombie Dragon isn't fun,You got it after I said not to? I'm glad you at least enjoyed it,This game is still the worse tales game I've ever laid my eyes on,In speaking of that,,Here's a really cool wallpaper I found of Velvet Crowe,YES PLS,,Haha. Anyway.  Tales of Berseria out of the two of them is a worthy game to play imo. I enjoyed the story. And gameplay is much improved over the trash that was Zestiria,Quite a bit weird to get used to the free flow run system that berseria has going for it.,Oof,Baka ya ro,I can't read ur weeb,Ahh,There's the readable weebspeak,,OMG lol,Pretty decentlyyyy~,Other than the unfortunate events that have occurred on your side. How have you beeen,Welcome to the fun zone,I clicked on that link and I was like. wtf is this lewd stuff doing here. But I forgot that's was the last thing I was looking at on Tumblr,,Hai.

Really embarrassing,,Pls no senpaiiii.,,,Morning everyone~,,Second this,Also I can suggest Tales of the Abyss,Nope,It's actually the one I suggest to people who wants to get into the final fantasy series,It's the great mixture of story telling. Narrative, and gameplay we expect from final fantasy,I like 9 alot,It's definitely good. But for first time FF players like Urp. I'd suggest 10,Its modern enough to feel enjoyable and still has the mechanics we enjoy,Oh ya,Makes no sense at first glance,9's progression was more.. traditional yeah,Platinum Games Silent Bomber remake,Faithful to the original. Improved in every way,I can't even imagine this,It's beyond my realms to grasp,Expanding on that would be very nice yeah,He said best,Not the ones that'll make you cry,... I still need to beat Nocturne,God,FF7 is a cake walk,Thanks,Differing opinions,Oh I mean in terms of difficulty,I wouldn't suggest Nocturne to someone,That's just like.

I think I'll just stick to wasting the money on commissioned art or something,Mechatronic suit? oh my,I'm planning on going to FWA next year,I'm 30 mins away from atlanta..

I'd slap them on my car too,but then I'd need a car,haha,that looks weird, what are you up to with that?,Sorry to hear this. If you do possibly lose your job, good luck with the job search,out of state is a pain though, but if it helps you find a job then go for it,T_T poor engineer,you could also set the event up yourself and have some peeps come to you,I'm just in Clayton County. Don't think there are any furs here,I mean. Atlanta is really close so I'd just go to any meets that are accessible by MARTA for the time being,I'm sure we'd all make the effort for FWA at least,such a cute sticker ❤️,ew, but if there's money to be made,RIP.

I didn't think anything of it,well. I mean someone is going to enjoy your $9 and pizza,if you have the reciept. you might be able to go back after work and just apologize (hoping they'd give you another pizza),no clue,i shouldn't have wore my hoodie,woah. how much that suit cost you?,there's always enough space for poofy fur,I lost fun trying to draw. I made sketches but always wanted to improve on something. I wanted to improve angles. I just cannot grasp this concept at all,you know how to draw things like... faces but at an angle? starting with the circle and drawing on top of it as a guideline,It just comes naturally to so many people but I have no clue why I can't grasp this at all,glad I'm not alone in this.

It's flipping hot,whut. how's this possible? I'm sweating down here in Morrow,oh.,I don't own a suit o3o,I am also tired, I've no clue why I'm even at my computer right now,that's adorable,totally not awkward in public haha,>not socially awkward,how do you do it,you lost me at confidence,the joke hit a wall, anyway,you've awoken a demon inside of someone that day,I'd still pat your business casual clothing,*pats Engineer*,being big and in suit only makes me wanna pet you some more. but I'll respect your boundaries,well. how old are you?,I'm running Kali.

I liked it. A criticism I have is that I want to hear more of Milo's inner dialouge, his thoughts, the connections his brain makes to the scene around him. You focused lot on the physical actions of the scene, which you did well on,But then again, lots of that can be fixed with more time, but this is a game ofc (to fit in Telegram),Yessss,woah, the color is so cool,I like the pattern too,he's also shirtless,,Will Milo also be shirtless?,like... swallowing in one gulp?,As seeing there was quite the interest with Pokemon amongst the Atlantic Station meet, I kinda want to make a small subgroup of those who play Pokemon,we can battle and trade, because I've been missing alot of that from long ago,organize meets with strangers who are into dressing up in animal costumes,storm, stay in north georgia.

I could have sworn that person was flipping real,whew.,that'd bug me too. Awesome for having a dream journal,I've gauged quite a bit of interest in Pokemon, I was wondering if people were willing to make a small sub group for Pokemon players in Georgia... we can trade and battle and stuff,That's if we have a good amount of people who play the game (watch the show eww),Yes bro. Pokemon Sun/Moon was FIRE,what? you didn't like it?,Pokemon games are generally easy anyway?

 Source: ,[object Object],Erm. I feel like they are experimenting with trying to get a Bethesda game experience in multiplayer. Surely they can do a light hearted entry into the franchise for the ones who never touched a fallout game and it's like slipping their foot inside,I wouldn't necessarily boycott it because they are definitely trying their best to make this game great for both Fallout fans and non Fallout fans,I'd give them the artistic freedom to give it a try,But we did get Fallout 4 pretty recently compared to Metroid Prime Federation jfc,I'd like to make comparison to Pokemon Let's Go. In the sense it's not the Switch Pokemon Game that we've been looking forward to but no one is boycotting it. It's completely streamlined the Pokemon Game experience. Should it also not deserve to make sales?,I apologise that I've stepped on territory that would generally be classified as "nostalgia glasses syndrome". I'm actually really supportive of Bethesda giving their best shot of weaving multiplayer with their iconic single player experience.,I'm aware that they are quite different games. but what makes Fallout 3-4 (to) Fallout 76 reason to be boycott instead of Pokemon to Pokemon Let's Go?,they are both experimenting with changing up the formula slightly and seeing how well it could work,ahh nah, I just want to really get down to the reason why people would hate on Fallout 76. (It's gonna be my first fallout game since my friends are like WE HAVEE TO PLAY IT TOGETHER),*brings you in for a hug*,,mmm i dunno,ahh, I mean I honestly forgot the difference between a casual gamer and a uhh gamer.,it just seems like the lines have been blurred for me honestly,if you could redefine it for me that'd be great,would make sure we are speaking the same language here,these stickers are great lol,,[object Object], nova arkane,oh well,no one uploaded me to it,[object Object], captainzepto frottage badger,[object Object], captainzepto frottage badger,boom,found me,It's much better than I thought it'd be.

I suck at Madden,nice,I can't imagine my free time not being used for games.,What games did you used to play?,games are always fun. can't imagine my time being used for other things,oh. those games that can be beaten in a few hours and have little to no story,i got sad when i beat titanfall 2 so quick.

The game is actually fun while also being lewd at the same time. It's fun for the right reason.,It's free and I'm subscribed to their Patreon,Y e s,I mean the game is fun. The dialouge is definitely tropes ive seen in doujinshi,Its great,You crawl through a dungeon to encounter enemies. The battle system is based on a few gems to match in a three row. White for damage, orange for rage arts, blue for shield, purple for magic,Basically you can fix yourself up a build to make use of those gems based on what you are doing,Basic attacks dammit,I think you should give it a try. They are actually making the battle system great and well designed,For a porn game,Their Patreon updates are mostly about how they are tweaking the difficulty and battle mechanics to add new spells and techs,I'd like there to be some complexity to figure out and make theorycrafting fun,Like Wizards of Legend is really simple,Beat you,Off,Kemo Coliseum is fun and lewd tho,Damn. Called me on my bluff,D a m n,Didnt have to do him like that,I think Kemo Coliseum is in a weird place for this. The lewd jokes in the scenes are sufficient enough until the next sexy times. But the gameplay is also simple enough yet also has some depth,I'll keep throwing this out cause. It's a good adult kemono game I've been looking for,Dammit,False,I'm going to keep shoving Kemo Coliseum till u play it,Good.
